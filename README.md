### P.S. You should know

If you are willing to participate in the course, you need to understand that
you’ll spend a lot of time building something big together — a new way
of learning and collaborating. You’ll become part of a small family
and should prepare yourself to find new friends and to invest a lot in this
friendship (as you should in any friendship).

Final task of this course will be to split into groups and create new courses
like that (and we’ll never stop).

#### Our basic rules

- Respect each other.
- [There is no such thing as a stupid question][wiki-stupid-question].
- Each person learns with their own speed, has different background and
  personality, please respect this.
- Communicating and understanding people that are different from you
  can be beneficial to both parties, provided mutual respect.
- We are against any discriminations by gender, age, the color of skin,
  disabilities or any other.
- We respect intellectual property - there is hard work of an author
  or a group of authors behind all materials that we use.
